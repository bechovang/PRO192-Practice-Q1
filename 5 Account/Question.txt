QUESTION: Write a class named Account in the default package.

1. Class Attributes (all private):
   - accHolder: String (account holder name)
   - balance: double (account balance in dollars)
   - isLoyal: boolean (true if loyal customer, false otherwise)

2. Constructors:
   - Account(): Default constructor.
   - Account(String accHolder, double balance, boolean isLoyal): Parameterized constructor setting all attributes.

3. Methods:
   - getAccHolder(): String
     -> Returns the account holder name with proper formatting.
     -> Logic: If accHolder is empty string (""), return "Unknown".
     -> Otherwise, return the name with FIRST LETTER UPPERCASE and ALL OTHER LETTERS LOWERCASE.
     -> Example: "john" becomes "John", "JANE DOE" becomes "Jane doe"
   
   - getFee(): double
     -> Returns the account fee based on loyalty status.
     -> Logic: If isLoyal is true, fee is 0.0 (no fee).
     -> If isLoyal is false, fee is 5% of balance (balance * 0.05).
   
   - toString(): String
     -> Returns a string formatted as: "accHolder, balance"
     -> Note: 'accHolder' must be formatted using getAccHolder() logic.
     -> Note: 'balance' must be displayed in its original form (no formatting, as-is).
     -> Format: no quotes, just: accHolder, balance

Example Output:
John, 1000.0
Unknown, 500.5
