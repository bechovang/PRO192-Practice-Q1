QUESTION: Write a class named Book in the default package.

1. Class Attributes (all private):
   - title: String
   - price: double
   - category: String

2. Constructors:
   - Book(): Default constructor.
   - Book(String title, double price, String category): Parameterized constructor setting all attributes.

3. Methods:
   - getTitle(): String
     -> Returns the title with the FIRST CHARACTER in lowercase and ALL OTHER CHARACTERS in uppercase.
     -> Example: "Java" becomes "jAVA", "OOP" becomes "oOP"
   
   - getSalePrice(): double
     -> Returns the sale price after discount.
     -> Logic: If category is "IT" (case-insensitive: "it", "It", "IT", "iT"), apply 15% discount (multiply by 0.85).
     -> Otherwise, return the original price without discount.
   
   - toString(): String
     -> Returns a string formatted as: "TITLE, salePrice"
     -> Note: 'TITLE' must be formatted using getTitle() logic.
     -> Note: 'salePrice' must be formatted to 2 decimal places (e.g., 85.00).
     -> Format: no quotes, just: TITLE, salePrice

Example Output:
jAVA, 85.00
