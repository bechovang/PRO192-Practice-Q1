QUESTION: Write a class named Room in the default package.

1. Class Attributes (all private):
   - roomId: int
   - type: String
   - area: double

2. Constructors:
   - Room(): Default constructor.
   - Room(int roomId, String type, double area): Parameterized constructor setting all attributes.

3. Methods:
   - getType(): String
     -> Returns the room type by taking ONLY THE FIRST 3 CHARACTERS and converting them to UPPERCASE.
     -> Example: "Deluxe" becomes "DEL", "Standard" becomes "STA"
     -> If the type has fewer than 3 characters, return the entire type in uppercase.
   
   - getRentPrice(): double
     -> Returns the rent price based on area.
     -> Logic: If area > 50.0, rent price is 200.0 dollars.
     -> If area <= 50.0, rent price is 100.0 dollars.
   
   - toString(): String
     -> Returns a string formatted as: "roomId - TYPE - rentPrice"
     -> Note: 'TYPE' must be formatted using getType() logic.
     -> Note: 'rentPrice' must be shown as a whole number (no decimal places).
     -> Format: no quotes, just: roomId - TYPE - rentPrice

Example Output:
101 - DEL - 200
